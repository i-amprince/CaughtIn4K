Automated Quality Inspection System

1. Introduction

This use case diagram represents the behavioral aspects of the Automated Quality Inspection (AQI) System. The system is designed to automatically detect product defects using computer vision techniques while incorporating human validation and continual learning.

The diagram shows the interaction between external actors and the system, as well as the relationships among different use cases.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Actors

The following external actors interact with the system:

1. Quality Operator
   - Captures or uploads product images.
   - Initiates anomaly detection.
   - Views classification results.
   - Validates inspection results.
   - Corrects false positives and marks missed defects.
   - Views inspection history.
   - Monitors performance.

2. Manufacturing Engineer
   - Updates the model incrementally.
   - Views inspection history.
   - Monitors system performance.

3. System Administrator
   - Manages system configuration.
   - Monitors system performance.

4. Industrial Camera (External)
   - Provides real-time product images to the system.
   - Connected to the "Capture Image" use case.

5. System Database (External)
   - Stores inspection results and human feedback.
   - Provides stored data for viewing history and performance monitoring.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Main Functional Flow

The main workflow of the system is as follows:

1. The Quality Operator captures or uploads images
2  The image get preprocessed
3. The system performs Anomaly Detection.
3. Anomaly Detection includes:
   - Localise Defective Regions
   - Generate Confidence Score
   - Generate Visual Explanations
   - Classify Products
4. The classification result is stored in the System Database.
5. The Quality Operator validates the inspection result.
6. If errors are found:
   - Correct False Positives (extend)
   - Mark Missed Defects (extend)
7. Human feedback is stored.
8. Validated feedback is used to update the model incrementally.
9. Inspection history can be viewed.
10. Performance can be monitored.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Include Relationships
The dashed lines represent include relationships and all the others are associative relationships.
The following use cases use <<include>> relationships because they always occur as part of the main process:

- Anomaly Detection includes:
  • Preprocess Image
  • Localise Defective Regions
  • Generate Confidence Score
  • Generate Visual Explanations
  • Classify Products

- Classify Products includes:
  • Store Inspection Result
  • Validate Inspection Result
  

- Validate Inspection Result includes:
  • Correct False Positives
  • Mark Missed Defects
  • Update Model Incrementally

- Store Human Feedback includes:
  • Use Validated Feedback

- Use Validated Feedback includes:
  • Update Model Incrementally

- View Inspection History includes:
  • Monitor Performance

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Conclusion

The use case diagram clearly illustrates:
- The interaction between human users, hardware devices, and the AQI system.
- The automatic defect detection process.
- The human-in-the-loop validation mechanism.
- The continual learning process through feedback integration.
