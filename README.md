# Automated Quality Inspection Using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project implements an Automated Quality Inspection system using Computer Vision techniques. The system analyzes product images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect defects and classify products as defective or non-defective. The goal is to reduce manual inspection effort, improve accuracy, and increase efficiency in quality control processes.

## Objectives
- Automate the quality inspection process
- Reduce human errors in inspection
- Improve inspection speed and consistency
- Provide reliable defect detection using deep learning

## System Description
The system accepts product images as input, preprocesses them, and applies a trained CNN model to identify defects. The output includes the inspection result along with visual feedback highlighting defective regions.

## Architecture
Image Input → Image Preprocessing → CNN Model → Defect Detection → Result Display

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
